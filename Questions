Notes on Project or questions/suggestions

Sorry I know this is way late in the game!
I was hoping to look over all your code so far and see if anything needs editing after I understand
what is going on. If anything needs to be done let me know. I would like to review all your codes and 
hopefully if any questions come up as I go you can answer them here. 

newline variable is in places all over. 
Is there such thing as header files in MIPS to add Constants that we can implement in every program? 
Instead of having it all over? 

Currently in Creation.asm…
Line 128 why -97? 
In fact, what is the Table supposed to have inside. Could you explain it to me?
From what I can maybe guess is it is looping down from 9 -> 0 and breaks after to the next thing,
but I’m not sure what values except the fact the table is 26*4bytes.
