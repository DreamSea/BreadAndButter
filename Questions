Notes on Project or questions/suggestions so far

A) Currently in Creation.asm…

newline variable is places all over. 
Is there such thing as header files in MIPS? instead of having it all over? make it global in one file? 

Line 128 why -97? What is the Original Table supposed to contain. 
I can see is it is looping down from 9 -> 0 and breaks to the next thing,
but I’m not sure what values except the fact the table is 26*4. 
What does OriginalTable supposed to contain and compare and what does the CheckTable contain?
I am guessing the OrginalTable contains the valid words CheckTable contains the guess?

Overview of 
Creation.asm->(Set Data Variables and Global Functions)->
ScrabbleList -> WipeOriTable -> MakeOriTable (in the same function it sets up a list to be written to)
->CheckList (Sets Variables to pass to openFile)-> OpenFile
->GrabNext (called to grab next item to be compared. -
This function is thrown in the beginning when grabbing -
the first string to compare and when comparisons are -
not equal in LoopCheck)
-> NextWord(Returns word from file buffer)

In GrabNext function: 
After grabbing first string to be compared: If Last letter != '@'
—>(reset chkTable) -> WipeCheck -> LoopCheck ->(If comparisons are equal)-> CopyWord
Else 
—>FinishUp (Closes file)
